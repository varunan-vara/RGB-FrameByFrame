# RGB-FrameByFrame

 This was a repository made to publish some code used in my Chemistry Internal Assessment. To use, change the pixel, file location and image folder location before running. 

 What does it do: It takes a snapshot of a video after a set amount of time, and saves the image in a folder for further examination. It then receives the RGB value of an image from a pixel specified in the code and writes it to a "results.csv".
